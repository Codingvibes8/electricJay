            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                If your home or business has been flooded, then you will need an Electrical Installation Condition Report (EICR) from a registered electrician. This will identify the condition of the wiring and electrical equipment that is in need of repair. This includes testing all fixed equipment, such as, an electric cooker, storage heaters, boilers, etc. and the portable electrical appliances affected by the flood.
            </p>

            <p className="text-lg mb-4">
                It is very important that you do not attempt to turn back on the electricity mains supply until an electrical safety assessment has been done.
